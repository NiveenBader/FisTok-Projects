                rel="noopener noreferrer">Organic certification</a></p>
        <p class="text">Standards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture.
            Standards may
            be voluntary
            or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s,
            governments began
            to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most
            notably with the
            1991 EU-Eco-regulation developed for European Union, which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK
            program.
            The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the National
            Organic Program
            (NOP). As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming (IFOAM 2007:11). In 2005 IFOAM created the
            Principles
            of Organic Agriculture, an international guideline for certification criteria. Typically the agencies
            accredit
            certification groups rather than individual farms.

            Production materials used for the creation of USDA Organic certified foods require the approval of a NOP
            accredited
            certifier.

            EU-organic production-regulation on "organic" food labels define "organic" primarily in terms of whether
            "natural" or
            "artificial" substances were allowed as inputs in the food production process.</p>
        <h2>Composting</h2>
        <p class="text">Using manure as a fertilizer risks contaminating food with animal gut bacteria, including
            pathogenic strains
            of E. coli
            that have caused fatal poisoning from eating organic food. To combat this risk, USDA organic standards
            require that
            manure must be sterilized through high temperature thermophilic composting. If raw animal manure is used,
            120 days must
            pass before the crop is harvested if the final product comes into direct contact with the soil. For products
            that do not
            directly contact soil, 90 days must pass prior to harvest.

            In the US, the Organic Food Production Act of 1990 (OFPA) as amended, specifies that a farm can not be
            certified as
            organic if the compost being used contains any synthetic ingredients. The OFPA singles out commercially
            blended
            fertilizers [composts] disallowing the use of any fertilizer [compost] that contains prohibited
            materials.</p>
