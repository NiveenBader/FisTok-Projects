        <h2>Crop diversity</h2>
        <p>Organic farming encourages crop diversity by promoting polyculture (multiple crops in the same space).
            Planting a
            variety of vegetable crops supports a wider range of beneficial insects, soil microorganisms, and other
            factors that add
            up to overall farm health. Crop diversity helps the environment to thrive and protects species from going
            extinct.
            The science of Agroecology has revealed the benefits of polyculture, which is often employed in organic
            farming.
            Agroecology is a scientific discipline that uses ecological theory to study, design, manage, and evaluate
            agricultural
            systems that are productive and resource-conserving, and that are also culturally sensitive, socially just,
            and
            economically viable.

            Incorporating crop diversity into organic farming practices can have several benefits. For instance, it can
            help to
            increase soil fertility by promoting the growth of beneficial soil microorganisms. It can also help to
            reduce pest and
            disease pressure by creating a more diverse and resilient agro-ecosystem. Furthermore, crop diversity can
            help to
            improve the nutritional quality of food by providing a wider range of essential nutrients.</p>
        <h2>Soil management</h2>
        <p>Organic farming relies more heavily on the natural breakdown of organic matter than the average conventional
            farm, using
            techniques like green manure and composting, to replace nutrients taken from the soil by previous crops.
            This biological
            process, driven by microorganisms such as mycorrhiza and earthworms, releases nutrients available to plants
            throughout
            the growing season. Farmers use a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation,
            cover cropping,
            reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing fuel-intensive tillage, less soil organic matter is
            lost to the
            atmosphere. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which reduces greenhouse gases and helps
            reverse climate
            change. Reducing tillage may also improve soil structure and reduce the potential for soil erosion.</p>
        <h2>Weed management</h2>
        <p>Organic weed management promotes weed suppression, rather than weed elimination, by enhancing crop
            competition and
            phytotoxic effects on weeds.Organic farmers integrate cultural, biological, mechanical, physical and
            chemical
            tactics to manage weeds without synthetic herbicides.

            Organic standards require rotation of annual crops,[54] meaning that a single crop cannot be grown in the
            same location
            without a different, intervening crop. Organic crop rotations frequently include weed-suppressive cover
            crops and crops
            with dissimilar life cycles to discourage weeds associated with a particular crop.[53] Research is ongoing
            to develop
            organic methods to promote the growth of natural microorganisms that suppress the growth or germination of
            common
            weeds.

            Other cultural practices used to enhance crop competitiveness and reduce weed pressure include selection of
            competitive
            crop varieties, high-density planting, tight row spacing, and late planting into warm soil to encourage
            rapid crop
            germination.</p>
